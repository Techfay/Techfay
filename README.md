# Shivangi Pandey

**Cloud Engineer & Cloud Solution Architect | 5+ years of experience | 5x AWS Certified & 2x Azure Certified | Ex-Infosys (Intel Client)**

# About Me.

I bring **5 years of experience as a Senior Systems Engineer at Infosys**, where I delivered **end-to-end cloud and IT infrastructure support for Intel** across **AWS, Azure, and on-premises environments**. My work spanned **Windows Server, Linux, VMware/Hyper-V, vRA**, and cloud platforms, with a strong focus on **automation, monitoring, reliability, and operations**.

I have hands-on experience designing and supporting **scalable, highly available, and cost-optimised cloud environments**, leveraging **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation)** and **AWS-native CI/CD**. I contributed to achieving **99.95% uptime** and **30–40% MTTR reduction** through effective monitoring, patching, and operational best practices.

I recently completed my **Master’s in Cloud Computing from the National College of Ireland (NCI)**, which strengthened my expertise in **cloud architecture, scalable systems, DevOps, and modern cloud practices**. I’m passionate about **building, designing, and architecting secure, scalable, and highly available cloud environments**.
